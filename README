== INSTALLATION ==
Just install the gem, by doing:
gem install dirscanner-x.x.x.gem

or downloading the source at:
git clone git@github.com:milare/dirscanner.git


== USING ==
After installing, require dirscanner:

require "dirscanner"

Every time you need to scan a directory just call:

Dirscanner.scan( "dir_path" )

To check the files status, by example:
files = Dirscanner.list_files

where files is a hash of arrays with the keys:
- files["new"]
- files["updated"]
- files["kept"]

The values are arrays with the files full path.
Check out the demo.rb.
